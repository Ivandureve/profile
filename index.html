            <p>The Airbus A380 is my favorite comercial airplane, as the concord is now out of the game! The 380 is spacious and really silencious. It also bring inboard a bunch of new technology such as virtual reality, making the cockpit a really interesting place to visit.

          <th class="space"><h3>Private</h3><br>
            <p>The Cirrus SR22 is a single-engine four- or five-seat composite aircraft built from 2001 by Cirrus Aircraft of Duluth, Minnesota.  It is a development of the Cirrus SR20, with a larger wing, higher fuel capacity, and a more powerful, 310-horsepower (231 kW) engine.  The SR22 has been the world's best-selling single-engine, four-seat aircraft every year since 2004.  It is equipped with a whole-plane emergency recovery parachute system, the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). This has contributed to its market success and has given it the name "the plane with the parachute".</p>

            <p>The A5 is a high-wing flying boat-type amphibious monoplane with a carbon fiber airframe and retractable undercarriage. It seats two people in an enclosed 46-inch-wide (116.8 cm) cockpit. The wings can be folded aft for ground transport and storage. Equipment includes an angle of attack indicator, an unusual feature in general aviation aircraft. A whole-airframe Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute is optional, except for in U.S.-registered A5s where it is mandatory, due to ICON's exemption to the U.S. LSA weight limit. The A5 uses many different design elements to provide a manageable stall recovery </p>
